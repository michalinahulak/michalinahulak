# ðŸ‘‹ HELLO WORLD! ðŸ‘‹

#### Welcome to my Github! 
:computer: I have several public repositories here, feel free to browse. My projects are about Data Science (Machine Learning, AI). I really like constructive feedback, so I encourage you to leave suggestions and comments in the 'give feedback' section.

:lollipop: So far, my professional career has been related to the sugar industry. In July 2022, I started my adventure with Data Science, which is developing very quickly. I am ready for new challenges!

:woman: I am open and willing to work in a team, so if you are looking for a collaborator - you can write to me.
